# STL-LSTM
We propose an ensemble hybrid model called seasonal trend decomposition based on Loess and long short-term memory (STL-LSTM) for forecasting non-stationary, nonlinear, and seasonal agricultural price series. The model integrates STL, a decomposition technique, with a recurrent neural network-based forecasting method, long short-term memory (LSTM). The STL technique decomposes the original price series into its seasonal, trend, and remainder components, while the LSTM network forecasts each component individually. The predictions from all components are then aggregated to produce the final ensemble forecast. The developed model effectively captures the temporal patterns of complex time series through the analysis of the simplified decomposed components.
